# Code Description

This Python script trains a multi-label classification model for skin condition classification using text data from an excel file; which was given to us by L'Oreal. The code:

- Loads the dataset, separating text (text_raw) from multiple label columns.

- Converts text to TF-IDF features.

- Splits data into 80/20 train-test sets.

- Trains a Random Forest classifier within a MultiOutputClassifier for multi-label predictions.

- Tracks carbon emissions during training with CodeCarbon.

- Evaluates performance using accuracy, macro precision, macro F1-score, and a per-label classification report.
